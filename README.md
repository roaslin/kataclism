# ü•ã‚õ©Ô∏è Kataclism
This project aims to facilitate the life of all the **TDD disciples** and **kata practicioners**, which works with `JavaScript` or `TypeScript`.
As we know, in order to do a kata we need to setup always the same boring stuff, like `test`and `src` directories; moreover, we need to setup all the tooling that nowadays we need as JavaScript developers (babel, prettierc etc).
I created this package to **reduce the time spent on bootstrapping the kata structure, and let the developer starts immediately to work on the kata**.

# Usage
To globally install kataclism run:

```console
npm install -g kataclism
```

## How does it works?
There are two ways of using `kataclism`:

### 1. Create a new empty project:
<img src="https://github.com/glippi/kataclism/blob/master/images/kataclism-js.png" />

Call kataclism with the argument `create` followed by the name of the project you want to start and kataclism will bootstrap the project.

#### Want to work with TypeScript?
<img src="https://github.com/glippi/kataclism/blob/master/images/kataclism-ts.png" />

Add `-t` option to bootstrap the project with TypeScript.


### 2. Choose one of the default katas:
<img src="https://github.com/glippi/kataclism/blob/master/images/kataclism-inquirer.png" />

Run kataclism without arguments and kataclism will prompt you with a list of some of the most used katas; navigate the list with the arrow keys, and select the kata you want to practice with enter.
By default, kataclism will generated a `README` with all the instructions needed for practicing the kata you choosed.

#### Folder Structure:
The following structure generated is for the `JavaScript` template:
```
|--src
   |---index.js
|--test
   |---index.test.js
|--package.json
|--README.MD
```
and this for `TypeScript`:
```
|--src
   |---index.ts
|--test
   |---index.test.ts
|--package.json
|--tsconfig.json
|--README.MD
```

## FAQ

##### How to run tests?
Execute `npm run test:once`, to run the tests once, or `npm run test:watch` to keep the tests executing on each change.
